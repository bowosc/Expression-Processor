<h3> Mathematical Expression Processor </h3>

<p> rpn.py contains a little library and some tools for solving infix-notation expressions. </p>

<p> This project converts a given expression from infix to outfix (Reverse Polish Notation), and then calculates the result.  </p>

<p> It accepts expressions, not equations, meaning there should be no "=" equals sign.  </p>
